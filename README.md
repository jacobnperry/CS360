    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    The goal of this class was to develop an Android app that would allow users to add data to a SQLLite database that would save as it's being updated.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
    The design of the app centered around 3 primary functions, one would be a login screen that would allow you to create a user profile, another would be the settings, and lastly is the actual log of data for viewing.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    
    I attempted to create my code to be as simple as possible, doing my best to not create redundancies or duplicate code with only small changes for specific functionality.
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    
    I tested my app by going through the process of "using" the app after it was built to see if the required functionality was present.
